The use of Computer Aided Detection (CADe) and Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx) for automatic interpretation of chest X-rays is a high interest research area in the computational biomedicine field. Not only that it could potentially provide physicians with a quick second opinion, but it also could relieve some of their stresses in their high risk/high stress working environment.
    Currently, commonly existing methods of interpreting chest X-ray images only classify and list potential findings without any localization on the image. This approach could lead inadvertently to misdiagnosis. A proper detection solution is highly needed and sought after to provide more relevant and meaningful support to doctors, especially at the very busy environment in which they work.
     In this study, we investigated applying the state-of-the-art Mask Region based Convolutional Neural Network (MR-CNN) to detect, classify, and localize 14 types of thoracic abnormalities usually diagnosed with chest radiographs. We used the Vingroup Big Dataâ€™s (VinBigData) "VinDr-CXR" open dataset for the training and testing of our neural network.
